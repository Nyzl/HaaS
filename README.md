# HaaS
 Hexagrams as a Service

 URL to acces the service: https://haas-eboe7b6oiq-nw.a.run.app/

 Built using Flask, deployed to Google Cloud Run. Utilising the GOV.UK design system, because it's nice and i don't want to write front end code.

 /api will return JSON for 6 generated hexagrams. the schema is as defined in src/hex.py

 /ascii_api will return ascii encoded json for handling hex and chinese characters
